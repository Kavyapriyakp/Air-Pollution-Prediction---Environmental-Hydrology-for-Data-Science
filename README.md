<h1 align="center"><a name="section_name">Air Pollution Prediction</a></h1>

<div align="justify">
Air pollution is becoming more and more relevant in recent times especially in a power-driven country like India. Our project aims to predict the air pollution levels and the air quality index in major Indian cities. Several factors like suspended particulate matter and amount of nitrogen molecules present are used to predict the target variable - Air Quality Index. Our project also aims to understand the major factors that cause air pollution and ways to reduce it.</div>

<div align="justify">

The code is developed with Python ver.3.8 and `pip` ver.21.0.1 in Windows OS and the same is tested on Ubuntu OS too. The necessary packages and frameworks can be installed from the *Requirements* directory.  However, one can follow the below mentioned steps in case of any errors.


```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 


Firstly, check the version of Python on your system using:


```Python
python --version
``` 

If you wish to change / upgrade the version or install Python afresh, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

`pip` is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages. It connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index. pip can also be configured to connect to other package repositories.  One can check `pip` version using:

```Python
pip --version
```

If you wish to install `pip` afresh, do:

```Python
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
